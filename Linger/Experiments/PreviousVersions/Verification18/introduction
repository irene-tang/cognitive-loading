instruct {Welcome.  In this experiment, you'll be reading individual statements on the computer screen and judging whether they are true or false.  You will first see a cross in the center of the screen. The cross will disappear and the words of the statement will appear one at a time in the center of the screen.  After each statement, you will be asked to judge whether it is true or false.  In order to respond, you will hit the "F" key if you think the statement is true and "J" if you think it is false.  You will be reminded which key is "true" and which is "false."  You should respond as quickly and accurately as possible.

If you are unsure of the answer, try to pick the best possible answer.

To be able to answer quickly, you should keep your index fingers resting on the "J" and "F" keys and your thumbs on the space bar.  This way you won't have to look down at the keys to answer.

}

instruct {You can take breaks as you need them, but please try to do so before you've started reading a new item, when the screen is blank.

If you have any questions about the procedure, ask the experimenter now.
